\subsection{Friends}
\label{ss:final-friends}
\textbf{SocialPlaces} also implements social interactions by allowing users to send, confirm and deny friend requests from other users.
Through this, users can not only view their \textit{pois} but also those owned by their friends, by opening the \textbf{Friends} screen from the main menu and tapping on one of their friends' name.
With this screen, users can also send friend requests and remove friends.

\noindent
When users receive a friend request they can either accept it or deny it. To do this, a dialog pops up after clicking on the notification and, when a user confirms it, the sender receive a notification.
An example is shown below.
