\subsection{Accuracy of the recommendation model}
\label{ss:accuracy-recommendation-model}

Overall we may say we obtained a very good dataset on the places part but a decent one about the human activity.
Given also the pre-processing steps on the obtained dataset for training the model, we immediately obtained an accuracy around 65\%, that is very good for such a small dataset (around 1700 rows).
We tried also to skip the oversampling (like we described in \hyperref[ss:recommendation-model]{Section 2.5}) but the results were very bad: we got an accuracy around 40\%.
After few validation tests, made while developing the mobile application, we noticed that the prediction made from the model were actually good.
We believe that with a certain amount of users sending feedbacks to the model for each recommendation, the accuracy of the model would actually increase in a short time.
