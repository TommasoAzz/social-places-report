\subsection{Accuracy of the recommendation model}

Overall we obtained a very good dataset about the places but a decent one about the human activity. Thanks to this, and to Oversample, we have immediatly
obtained an accuracy around 65\% that is very good for such a small dataset (arount 1700 row). We tried also without the oversample but the results were very bad,
 we get an accuracy around 40\%. After few validation test, made while developing the client, we saw that the prediction made from the model were actually good.
We think that with a few number of users that send feedback to the model for each recommendation it will increasly his accuracy in a short time.
