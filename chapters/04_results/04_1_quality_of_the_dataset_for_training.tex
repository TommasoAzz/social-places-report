\subsection{Quality of the dataset for training}
\label{ss:quality-training-dataset}

The dataset involved in the train of the model has multiple positive and negative aspect because it evolved during the preprocessing.
We started from geolife dataset that is a huge collection of trajectories of different users, this was a good starting point 
because with a big dataset we can train better our model. But obviously we had to preprocceses it to obtain a more meaningful data set. 
The precision of the stay points seems to be good thanks to the use of Places API from google that return us a lot of points near the point of the request.
And also we didn't have the human activity that the user from dataset was doing in that moment so we had to adapt it by generating in a random way to a certain
attention to use only walk and still for a restaurant.
