\subsection{Recommendation model}
\label{ss:recommendation-model}

Having a synthesized dataset allows us to train a classifier for the recommendation model.
For the purpose of our project we decided to use a \textit{decision tree} as a classifier.\\
Some steps are required before the training can take place:
\begin{itemize}
    \item the dataset is split into $X$ (the data columns) and $y$ (the target column, i.e., the category);
    \item the dataset is oversampled since it is quite small;
    \item the target column $y$ is one-hot encoded since the decision tree classifier requires only numerical values;
    \item the dataset needs to be splitted in training (70\%) and test (30\%);
\end{itemize}
The model is then trained with the training dataset and finally tested with the test dataset.
