\subsection{Backend architecture}
Like we wrote in \ref{ss:overall-system-architecture}, we designed also the backend of our system to support the functionalities the application offers.
A quick overview of the backend can be seen in the following diagram:
\begin{figure}[h]

    \caption{Backend Architecture}\label{img:backend_architecture}
\end{figure}
The backend architecture is composed by two main parts:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{APIs}, designed to satisfy all the requests coming from the mobile app;
    \item \textbf{Recommendation model}, which is a service that runs the classifier that generates recommendations given inputs by the APIs.
\end{itemize}

\label{sss:apis}
\subsubsection{APIs}
The Application Programming Interfaces of the backend handle all the incoming requests from the application.\\
We can subdivide them into five main subjects:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Friends API}, they enable users to send, accept, or deny friend requests and to retrieve their list of friends;
    \item \textbf{Points of interest API}, they enable users to add or remove pois from their poi list, retrieve their poi list and that of other friends;
    \item \textbf{Live Events API}, they enable users to add live events to the their live events list, retrieve their live event list;
    \item \textbf{User data API}, they enable users to send the backend their authentication and push notification tokens;
    \item \textbf{Recommendation API}, they enable users to register for receiving recommendation for generic places (i.e., pois) or for places of a specific category and to send data that enable the classifier to train again and improve its accuracy.
\end{itemize}

\label{sss:recommendation-model}
\subsubsection{Recommendation model}
The recommendation model part of the backend handles all the requests coming from the \textbf{Recommendation API}.\\
It acts as an interface to the classifier, which will be explained more in detail in \ref{sss:recommendation-model}.
