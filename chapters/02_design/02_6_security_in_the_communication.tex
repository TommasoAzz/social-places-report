\subsection{Security in the communication}

\subsubsection{HTTPS Server}
Obviously a security mechanism, to avoid tracking of the user, need to be implemented.\\
One starting idea is to use an https certificate for the sever, but this isn't enough.
We want to provide a function to obscure sensitive information during the request.
\subsubsection{Obscured communication}
There are a lot of good technique to hide sensitive information like cloacking or dummy updates.
But both client and server need to know the real actual position of the user. So we need \textbf{Location Privacy Protection Mechanism} end to end like an 
encryption function.
