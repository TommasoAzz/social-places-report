\subsection{Security in the communication}
\label{ss:security-in-communication}

\subsubsection{HTTPS Server}
A security mechanism, to avoid the communications being intercepted, needs to be implemented.\\
One starting idea is to use HTTPS as a communication protocol between the client (mobile application) and the server (the APIs), but we believe this is not enough.
We want to provide a way to obscure sensitive information during the communication, which is the location of the user that needs to be sent in order to receive recommendations.
\subsubsection{Obscured communication}
There are many techniques to hide location data, like spatial cloaking or dummy updates.
But since we want to know the actual current position of the user, we decided that it was best to leave the location data as-is and instead use an encrypted end-to-end communication, exploiting the RSA scheme.
