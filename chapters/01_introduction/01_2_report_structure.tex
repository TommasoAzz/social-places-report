\subsection{Report structure}
In the next sections we'll describe the architecture of the system composed by:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Android Client;
    \item Nodejs Server;
    \item Python Recommendation Model;
    \item APIs, divided in:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item APIs Client-Server;
        \item APIs Server-Model;
    \end{itemize}
    \item Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM);
    \item Firestore;
\end{itemize} 
After that we'll talk about the system development including model training and the APIs involved.
We'll conclude with a section dedicated to the results reached.
